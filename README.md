# Project Descriptions

Project 1 : Turtle Program Birthday Scenery

Description: This Python-based program is an interactive tool that allows users to design a custom scene featuring a table, cake, and decorations. The program is structured into distinct functions for creating each element, ensuring organized execution. User inputs drive the customization, determining aspects such as the tableâ€™s dimensions, the number of cake layers, and the color scheme. The goal is to provide a user-friendly platform for creating personalized, artistic renderings using Python Turtle commands.

Project 2 : Checkers and Image Drawing

Description : These programs utilize the Python Turtle module to create interactive graphical representations. The first program, titled "Activity 2 - Drawing", allows users to draw multiple strings on a canvas. It incorporates a "multiple_strings" function from the "functions" module and offers customization options for pixel size, pen color, and pen size. 

The second program, titled "Activity 2 - Checkers", uses a "checkers" function from the "functions" module to draw a checkers board. The board's pixel size, number of rows, and number of columns can be specified by the user. Both programs are executed as the main module, invoking the main() function. They provide a user-friendly interface for creating personalized graphics using Python Turtle commands.
